# *meh* â€” Audiostreams as podcasts [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pascalj/meh.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pascalj/meh)  
*meh* is a Ruby web application that records parts from online audiostreams and provides them as podcasts. Perfect if your favorite radio show is not available as a podcast.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

**[Redis](http://redis.io/)** and **[Streamripper](http://streamripper.sourceforge.net/)** both must be installed in order for *meh* to work. Most Linux distributions have packages ready for you. Both are in the FreeBSD ports.

### Instructions

Clone *meh* into the target directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:pascalj/meh.git
```

Use bundler to install all dependencies:

```
cd meh && bundle install --without development
```

Start sidekiq:

```
sidekiq -d
```

Start the webserver:

```
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails s
```

Meh should now be running. Now add a stream and a podcast and run:

```
rake meh:schedule
```

It will schedule the actual recordings. If you're running *meh* on a webserver you should install a cronjob to execute this rake task regularly. Once a week should be sufficient, but you can execute it more often, if you're more comfortable with that.

**Note:** It's important to set the timezone correctly or *meh* will assume UTC for the podcats' starting times.
Example for Berlin in `config/application.rb`:

`config.time_zone = 'Berlin'`

## Contributing

If you find a bug or want to add something please send me a pull request. I'll be glad to merge it. Just make sure the tests are passing by running `rake spec`. If you add code, please consider adding tests for it. Bug reports are also highly appreciated.
*meh* uses [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) to make the development easier. To import the VM and set everything up, just install Vagrant and run `vagrant up`. You can ssh into the VM via `vagrant ssh`. The source is mounted at `/vagrant`.
